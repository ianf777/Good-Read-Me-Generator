This assignment requires the developer to create an application which takes user input and outputs it into a formatted README file. Creating a readme can take time,
so when it is able to be generated quickly and decisively it saves developers a lot of time. The application was developed entirely using Node.Js technologies. 
In order to take user input using a command prompt, we must utilize the inquirer npm, allowing us then to take the users input and transform it into a readme for them.
